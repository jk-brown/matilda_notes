# Proposed changes to score functions.

Following first walks through the two scoring functions (`score_ramp` and `score_bayesian`) and explains the changes made and the shows examples of the output.

Then, I show changes to `score_hruns` which has an added step of converting the input Hector data to a matrix of values (will be input for scoring function). I give a final example to show the functionality. 

```{r}
# loading Matilda
library(matilda)
```

### `score-ramp`

The function `score_ramp` now takes a matrix rather than an`x` and `y` vector. The subsequent arguments (w1, w2, etc.) remain the same: 

First, I initialize a matrix to store results of the loop - `score_matrix`. The matrix object has the same number of rows and cols as the inputs matrix (this is the year range of the scoring criterion). 

Then, I loop across the input matrix for each column from 2 to the end of the matrix (`2:ncol(matrix)`). In the loop I indicate the first col as the `obs_data` and all subsequent (`i`) cols as `model_data`.

The loop computes scores in the same way as it was originally done. Absolute values are computed for each pair of observed value and modeled value. Then it assesses the the abs_difference and scores accordingly between 0-1. In short, scores are compared with the user provided w1 and w2 values and are scored according to that range. 

Calculated scores are stored in the `score_matrix` (with the first column a vector of NAs). 

The final step is computing the mean scores for each model iteration (matrix column), while excluding the first column.

Function returns a vector of scores for each model iteration.

```{r}
#' Computing Model Scores Using Ramp Method
#'
#' @description This function uses observed data to compute scores that represent 
#' how well modeled values reflect what is happening in reality. Scores that are 
#' closer to 1 indicated skillful models, while scores closer to 0 indicate models
#' that produce values that deviate further from observed data.
#'
#' @param m Matrix of values. The first column of the matrix should be 
#' a vector of observed data. Subsequent vectors are representative of modeled 
#' values for a given variable.   
#' @param w1 Difference at which score begins to ramp down from a 1. 
#' @param w2 Difference at which score hits 0. 
#' @param na.omit How should \code{score_ramp} deal with rows in matrix that 
#' contain NAs? Defaults to \code{FALSE}, leaving NAs in the matrix. 
#'
#' @return Returns a vector of scores with a length equal to the number of 
#' model iterations in the input matrix. Or, if the input matrix has K columns, 
#' the return vector will = K - 1.    
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # creating sample matrix
#' mat <- matrix(data = 1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
#' 
#' # scoring columns where scores <= 5 will score 1 and scores >= 10 will score 0 
#' score_ramp(mat, w1 = 5, w2 = 10)

score_ramp <- function(m, w1, w2, na.omit = FALSE) {
  
  # ensure that w1 argument is a value of at least 0 - no negative
  if (w1 < 0) stop("w1 must be at least 0")
  
  # ensure that w2 is at least as big as w1 - w2 should never be less than w1
  if (w2 < w1) stop("w2 must be at least as big as w1")
  
  # Initialize a matrix that will be occupied by model scores. The first column
  # of the matrix must be the observed data and will be removed before returning
  # the final output.
  scores_matrix <- matrix(NA_real_, nrow(m), ncol(m))
  
  # Stop execution if number of columns in the matrix is less the 2
  # indicates that there is only one model result stored in matrix
  stopifnot(ncol(m) > 2)
  
  # indicate that observed data are in first column of matrix
  obs_data <- m[, 1]
  
  # throw and error if the modeled data is all NAs  
  if (all(is.na(obs_data))) stop("No non-NA values in x")

  
  # loop across columns of the matrix. For each column (i) after col 2
  for (i in 2:ncol(m)) {

    # indicate modeled data are in subsequent columns
    model_data <- m[, i]
    
    # checks to ensure equal lengths between modeled and observed data 
    if (length(obs_data) != length(model_data)) stop("Length of x must be equal to length of y")
    
    # throw and error if the modeled data is all NAs  
    if (all(is.na(model_data))) stop("No non-NA values in y")
    
    # omit rows that have NA values in both obs_data and model_data
    if (na.omit) {
      obs_data <- na.omit(obs_data)
      model_data <- na.omit(model_data)}
    
    # Take absolute difference between obs_data and model_data value
    abs_diffs <- abs(obs_data - model_data)
    
    # Initializes vector that will be occupied with scores should be same length
    # as observed data
    scores <- rep(NA_real_, length(obs_data))
    
    # the order of the following two statements matters, because
    # we want a diff exactly equal to w1 to get a score of 1, even when w1 = w2
    scores [abs_diffs >= w2] <- 0
    scores [abs_diffs <= w1] <- 1
    
    # for abs_diffs between w1 and w2 - compute how far between w1 and w2 the
    # abs_diff value is
    between_w1_w2 <- abs_diffs > w1 & abs_diffs < w2
    w1_w2_frac <- (abs_diffs [between_w1_w2] - w1) / (w2 - w1)
    
    # for scores between w1 and w2 use (1 - computed distance) as score value
    scores [between_w1_w2] <- 1 - w1_w2_frac
    
    # store score values 
    scores_matrix [, i] <- scores
  }
  
  # calculates means scores for each column (model iteration)
  agg_scores <- colMeans(scores_matrix [, -1], na.rm = T)
  
  return(agg_scores)
}
```

#### Example:

```{r}
# creating sample matrix
mat <- matrix(data = 1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
 
# scoring columns where scores <= 5 will score 1 and scores >= 10 will score 0 
score_ramp(mat, w1 = 5, w2 = 10)
```

### `score_bayesian`

The `score_bayesian` function take a matrix with the same format as `score_ramp`. the decay factor `e` remains an additional argument.

After initializing a vector to store RMSE values from the loop, we run a loop the same way that we do in `score_ramp`. I loop each column from 2 to the end of the matrix (`2:ncol(matrix)`), indicating the first col as the `obs_data` and all subsequent (`i`) cols as `model_data`.

The RMSE values are then used in the later half of the function to compute `likelihood`, which is then used to compute `posterior_probs`. When `likelihood` is calculated the first value in the vector is removed - this value represents the obs_data and should be occupied with an NA.

```{r}
#' Calculating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 
#' 
#' @description Function takes vectors of modeled data values and compares them 
#' to observed data values to report the RMSE. 
#'
#' @param x A vector of modeled data values
#' @param y A vector of observed data values
#'
#' @return Returns a vector of RMSE values
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' x = c(1:5)
#' y = c(5:10)
#' 
#' RMSE_calc(x, y)

RMSE_calc <- function(x, y) {
  
  # compute RMSE
  rmse_vals = sqrt(mean((x - y)^2))
  
  # return a vector of RMSE values
  return(rmse_vals)
  
}

#' Computing Model Scores as Posterior Probabilities using Bayesian Inference
#'
#' @description This function uses observed data to compute scores that represent
#' how well modeled values reflect what is occurring in reality. To do this, the 
#' function uses root mean square error (RMSE) values to compute the likelihood
#' of observing modeled values given observed values, assuming normal distribution
#' of errors. Likelihood values are used to compute posterior probabilities which
#' are used as scores for each model iteration.
#'
#' @param m A Matrix of values. The first column of the matrix should be 
#' a vector of observed data for a give variable. Subsequent vectors should be 
#' representative of modeled values for a given variable.
#' @param e A values for 0-Inf. This value controls the decay rate. It controls 
#' how much models are penalized for deviation from observed data. The default is 
#' set to 2, larger values will increase rate of decay.
#'
#' @return Returns a vector of scores with a length equal to the number of 
#' model iterations in the input matrix. Or, if the input matrix has K columns, 
#' the return vector will = K - 1.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # creating sample matrix
#' mat <- matrix(data = 1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
#'
#' # scoring with a decay rate of 2               
#' score_Bayesian(mat, e = 2)

score_bayesian <- function(m, e = 2) {
  
  # initialize vector to store RMSE values from loop
  rmse_vector <- numeric() 
  
  # indicate that observed data are in first column of matrix
  obs_data <- m[, 1]
  
  # loop across columns of the matrix. For each column (i) after col 2
  for(i in 2:ncol(m)) {
  
  # indicate modeled data are in subsequent columns
  model_data <- m[, i]
  
  # compute RMSE using obs_data and model_data
  rmse_vals = RMSE_calc(obs_data, model_data)
  
  # vector of RMSE value for each model iteration 
  rmse_vector[i] <- rmse_vals
  
  }

  # Compute likelihood using normal distribution likelihood function.
  # This is the probability of observing the modeled data given the 
  # observed data.
  # Remove first value when calling rmse_vector (first values should be NA because
  # it represented obs_data)
  likelihood = exp(-0.5 * (rmse_vector[-1]) ^ e)
  
  # Computing unnormalized posterior scores 
  # Currently only computing posterior scores using uniform prior.
  # uniform prior is calculated as 1/length(likelihood) which is 
  # the same as 1 / # of runs.
  posterior = likelihood * (1 / length(likelihood))
  
  # Computes posterior probabilities - normalized posterior weights. 
  # Will sum to 1 and there for get significantly smaller as number 
  # of runs increases.
  posterior_probs = posterior / sum(posterior)
    
  # Create data frame of results - get run_numbers from the list where RMSE values
  # are computed (names of the split_list components)
  return(posterior_probs)
  
}
```

#### Example:

In this example columns (model iterations) deviate progressively.

This shows that iterations with lower RMSE values will have larger scores, and scores decrease as model iteration deviate from the observed data.

```{r}
# creating sample matrix
mat <- matrix(data = 1:40, nrow = 5, ncol = 8)

# scoring with a decay rate of 2               
score_bayesian(mat, e = 2)
```

### Edits to `score-hruns`

A couple of edits were made to `score_hruns` to maintain functionality using matrix data.

First, I have a new `value_matrix` function that converts Hector-form data output to a matrix.

I still have `score_hruns subsetting` the input to match the data of the criterion. The the modeled data are converted to matrix format, where each column represents a model iteration.

The `obs_dat` step is consistent with the previous `score_hruns` step, and I bind the observed data column of values to the `model_matrix`. This creates the input for either scoring function. The output is a data frame of scores and run_number. 

```{r}
#' Converting Hector Result to Matrix
#'
#' @param df Result data frame from \code{\link{iterate_hector}}.
#' @param columns Column name to select for inclusion in the matrix. Defaults to 
#' "value" which will use the values for each model iteration.
#'  
#' @return A matrix with columns representing a vector of values for each model 
#' iteration.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # Matrix hector result using model values
#' hector_matrix(hector_result, columns = "value")

hector_matrix <- function(df, columns = "value") {
  
  split_list <- split(df, df$run_number)
  
  subset <-
    lapply(split_list, function(x)
      subset(x, select = columns))
  
  df_wide <- do.call(cbind, subset)
  colnames(df_wide) <- NULL
  
  return(as.matrix(df_wide))
}

#' Screen Hector outputs with observed data
#'
#' @description This function uses any scoring function to screen Hector runs
#' based on proximity of climate variable values to observed data. Internal scoring
#' functions are provided in \code{matilda}, but users can also supply their own.
#' Criterion used for scoring are also available in the package. Alternatively,
#' users can build their own scoring criterion with \code{\link{new_criterion}}.
#'
#' @param x Result data frame from \code{\link{iterate_hector}}.
#' @param score_function Scoring function to use for screening Hector model runs.
#' @param criterion A scoring criterion to use for screening Hector runs.
#' @param ... Additional arguments needed to run the selected scoring function.
#'
#' @return Data frame of scored for each Hector run
#' @export
#'
#' @import stats
#'
#' @examples
#' # Score Hector using observed CO2 data with the score_ramp method
#' score_hruns(hector_result, criterion_co2_obs(), score_ramp, w1 = 2, w2 = 20)

score_hruns <- function(x, criterion, score_function,...) {
  
  # error if x is not a data frame
  if (!is.data.frame(x))
    stop('user supplied x is not a data frame')
  
  # error if criterion object is not a criterion
  if (!is.criterion(criterion))
    stop('user supplied crit is not a criterion')
  
  # error if score_function is not a function
  if (!is.function(score_function))
    stop('user supplied score_function is not a function')
  
  # subset to include years for CO2 screening
  x_subset <-
    subset(x, x$year %in% criterion$years &
              x$variable == criterion$var)
  
  # error if variable in x does not match variable in the criterion being used
  if (!nrow(x_subset))
    stop('criterion year and variable combination not represented in data')
  
  # converts x_subset to matrix - columns are vectors of values for each model iteration
  model_matrix <- value_matrix(x_subset, columns = "value")
  
  # creates observed data frame
  obs_dat <- data.frame(value_obs = criterion$obs_values)
  
  # merge hector results with calibration data observed CO2 data
  x_matrix <- cbind(obs_dat$value, model_matrix)
  
  # add new column to res_merge computing scores so that we can
  scores <- score_function(x_matrix, ...)
  
  return(data.frame(weights = scores,
                    run_number = 1:length(scores)))
  
}
```

We do have it set-up that the user can create there own scoring function. But I guess it will just be important to communicate that scoring function must be designed to take a matrix with the first column representing observed data and subsequent columns representing modeled data.

#### Example:

Here I show how `hector_matrix` works and then show `score_hruns`.

`hector_matrix` used on its own will convert the entire (non-subsetted) hector data frame to matrix form:

```{r}
# Matrix hector result using model values
hec_matrix_ex <- hector_matrix(hector_result, columns = "value")

head(hec_matrix_ex)
```

Using `score_hruns` runs through the entire matrix conversion and scoring process for whatever score function the user provides:

```{r}
# Score Hector using observed CO2 with the score_ramp method
ramp <- score_hruns(hector_result, criterion_co2_obs(), score_ramp, w1 = 2, w2 = 20)

head(ramp)
```

```{r}
# Score Hector using observed CO2 with score_bayesian method
bayes <- score_hruns(hector_result, criterion_co2_obs(), score_bayesian, e = 2)

head(bayes)
```
